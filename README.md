# Team Profile Generator

## My Work

### Description

This project allows a manager to generate an html file to view thier team.
They can select from 3 different kinds of employees- engineer/intern/manager
The user enters some data about the employees - and specific questions about certain job types
Once the users in done selecting the amount of profiles they want - they generate the html file!

### Install

### Future Updates

I would like to complete my style.css to make this much better to look at.

I also would like to add a way for the program to store the html file you generate and be able to add more to it using the appender!
